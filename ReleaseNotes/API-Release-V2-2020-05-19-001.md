# Release V2-2020-05-19
This is a minor release, that updates the customers endpoint. Focus of this release is to give the API a better way to handle the customer address.
## Address improvement
In the `PUT Customers` endpoint, the country should now be specified with the ISO countrycode, e.g. DK = Denmark, SE = Sweeden, etc...

## Send subscribe email
The endpoint `POST /customers/{customerNumber}/agreementRequest`, now handles `all` in the `type`-parameter, that enables the customer to decide what paymentinstrument should be used for this agreement.


## Update customer
When the customer is updated `POST /customers`, the values in `GLN` and `CompanyNo` can be cleared by specifying a dot (.)


### Example:
Updates the customer' country to be Denmark
```
{
  "CustomerNumber": "123",
  "CompanyNo": ".",
  "Gln": ".",
  "Name": "Hans",
  "Email": "hans@company.com",
  "Street": "Appelby plads",
  "HouseNumber": "120",
  "PostCode": "1411",
  "City": "KÃ¸benhavn K",
  "Country": "DK",
  "AttachPdfInvoice": true,
  "Language": "English"
}
```

Remark, that deleting GLN, and CompanyNo should be noted with a `.` 
```
{
  "Gln" : ".",
  "CompanyNo": "."
}

```

Remark, setting them to `null` or `""` (empty string) is omitting an update to the fields.
