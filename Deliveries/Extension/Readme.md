# Invoice Delivery extension
As the invoice can be expressed in the OIOUBL format, 
the delivery invoice extension is used to express how the invoice placed into FarPay.
The extension should be regarded as an instruction that overrrides the existng conventions
of:
* Distribution (e.g. email, print, SMS, E-boks, etc.)
* Payment flow (default, manual, automatic)
