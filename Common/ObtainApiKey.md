# Obtain an API key

An API key is only available for eligible merchants that have a FarPay subscription,
that exposes the API keys in the settings page in the WebApplication

Navigate to the Settings menu in the WebApplication: https://app.farpay.io/pages/settings.aspx, 
and scroll down to the API section, where your key is available.

If not available, and you are in need of the key, please contact FarPay at our support channels,
available from our site https://farpay.io
