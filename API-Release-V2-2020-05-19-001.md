# Release V2-2020-05-19
This is a minor release, that updates the customers endpoint. Focus of this release is to give the API a better way to handle the customer address.
## Address improvement
In the `PUT Customers` endpoint, the country should now be specified with the ISO countrycode, e.g. DK = Denmark, SE = Sweeden, etc...

## Send subscribe email
The endpoint `POST /customers/{customerNumber}/agreementRequest`, now handles `all` in the `type`-parameter, that enables the customer to decide what paymentinstrument should be used for this agreement.

## Update customer
When the customer is updated `POST /customers`, the values in `GLN` and `CompanyNo` can be cleared by specifying a dot (.)
