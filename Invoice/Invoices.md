# Invoices

The invoice endpoint `https://api.farpay.io/{version}/invoices` gives you access to all your invoices. And where you can handle the invoices on the fly, see payment states, and how the invoice is processed in FarPay. Use Case scenarios are:

* List invoices with optional filters
* Single invoice (deep view)
* Create an invoice
* Update invoice
* Delete an invoice

**Remark!** that [all requests must have](../All-Requests.md) an `X-API-KEY` and `Accept` mentioned in the header requests.
